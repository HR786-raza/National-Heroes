            <h1>Allama Iqbal</h1>
        </div>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Allama Iqbal, born on November 9, 1877, in Sialkot, was a philosopher, poet, and visionary thinker. Known as
            the "Spiritual Father of Pakistan", he awakened the Muslim Ummah with his poetry and ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            He passed away on April 21, 1938, before the creation of Pakistan, but his vision laid the intellectual
            foundation for it. His contributions in literature and philosophy were groundbreaking.
        </p>

        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>
            Iqbal's poetry in Persian and Urdu inspired a sense of pride, unity, and revival among Muslims. He
            introduced the concept of “Khudi” (selfhood) to encourage self-awareness and dignity.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1930, he proposed the idea of a separate homeland for Muslims, which later became Pakistan. His scholarly
            work earned him recognition worldwide.
        </p>

        <h2>Work for Country</h2>
        <p>
            Iqbal used his pen as a sword to uplift Muslims socially and politically. Through his speeches and writings,
            he awakened the collective consciousness of the Muslim world.
        </p>
        <p>
            He also served in the Punjab Legislative Council, where he advocated for Muslim rights and education
            reforms.
        </p>

        <h2>Nation’s Gratitude</h2>
        <p>
            Pakistan pays tribute to Allama Iqbal every year on Iqbal Day, November 9. His ideas still shape the
            nation's philosophical and cultural direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            The nation deeply thanks Iqbal for planting the seed of Pakistan. His mausoleum in Lahore is visited by
            millions who admire his contributions.

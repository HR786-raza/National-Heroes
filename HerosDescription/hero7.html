        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, born on April 1, 1936, was a highly respected nuclear scientist known as the "Father
            of Pakistan’s Nuclear Bomb." He was born in Bhopal, India, and migrated to Pakistan after the creation of
            the country. He earned a degree in metallurgical engineering and later specialized in nuclear physics in
            Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
            After returning to Pakistan in the 1970s, he dedicated his life to making the country self-reliant in
            nuclear technology. He passed away on October 10, 2021, leaving behind a legacy of unmatched scientific
            achievement and patriotism.

        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>
            Dr. A.Q. Khan founded the Kahuta Research Laboratories (KRL) and led the uranium enrichment program that
            enabled Pakistan to become a nuclear power. His work made it possible for Pakistan to conduct successful
            nuclear tests in 1998, which changed the country's position in global politics. He received many prestigious
            awards including Nishan-e-Imtiaz (twice).
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides his nuclear work, he also contributed to educational and social causes by establishing schools and
            scholarships. His achievements gave Pakistan a powerful defense system and global recognition.

        <h2>Work for Country</h2>
        <p>
            He made it his mission to make Pakistan strong and safe from external threats, especially from neighboring
            countries. Despite facing sanctions, he worked day and night with limited resources to develop nuclear
            capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            He trained many young scientists and helped build a foundation for future scientific growth. His dedication
            wasn’t just limited to defense; he also supported education and health initiatives to improve the lives of
            ordinary Pakistanis.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            Schools, roads, and science centers have been named after him. He is remembered every year for his
            invaluable services. The entire nation thanks him for his lifelong dedication and courage to dream big for

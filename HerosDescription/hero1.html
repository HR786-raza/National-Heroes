        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, born on December 25, 1876, was the founder of Pakistan. As a brilliant
            lawyer and politician, he led the Muslim League and envisioned a separate homeland for Muslims of the
            subcontinent. His leadership and strategic vision played a crucial role in the creation of Pakistan in 1947.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jinnah's clarity of thought and commitment to democracy and law made him a respected figure both in India
            and abroad. Despite his frail health, he worked tirelessly to lay the foundation of a new nation until his
            death on September 11, 1948.
        </p>

        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>
            Jinnah's greatest achievement was the creation of Pakistan through the successful negotiation of the
            partition plan. He unified diverse Muslim voices and turned the dream of a separate nation into a reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            He also framed the basic principles of the state: religious freedom, equality, and justice. His famous
            August 11 speech remains a cornerstone of Pakistan's democratic aspirations.
        </p>

        <h2>Work for Country</h2>
        <p>
            Jinnah spent his final years drafting policies and ensuring that Pakistan started on the right path. He
            handled communal tensions and refugee crises with strength and calm.
        </p>
        <p>
            He laid the groundwork for Pakistan’s constitution, emphasized minority rights, and advocated for a secular
            democratic state.
        </p>

        <h2>Nation’s Gratitude</h2>
        <p>
            The nation remembers Quaid-e-Azam with the highest respect and admiration. His birthday is celebrated as a
            national holiday in Pakistan.
        </p>
        <p>
            His vision and sacrifice continue to inspire generations. Pakistanis owe their identity, independence, and
            freedom to his tireless efforts and leadership.
